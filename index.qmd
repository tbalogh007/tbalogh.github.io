### Hello and welcome!

I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Political Science at [The University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/). I am also a 2024-2025 Bilinski Fellow.

My [research](research.qmd) falls at the intersection of political parties, political communication, and electoral behavior in advanced industrial democracies. I am interested in a wide range of questions related to how citizens form beliefs about politics, representation, and policy impacts, especially the influence of information, elite rhetoric, and other mass-elite linkages. During my Ph.D., I have also been involved with [The Institute for Replication](https://i4replication.org/).

Prior to starting graduate school, I received B.A.s in Political Science and Economics at Colorado State University in 2018 and worked as a Legislative Intern at the Colorado General Assembly.

When I am not working, I love doing most things outside (especially hiking and gravel biking), reading (literary fiction and narrative non-fiction are my favorites), and watching Formula 1 (Tifosi üèéÔ∏è).

### Research Interests

political parties | political communication | mass-elite linkages | electoral behavior |  representation | survey & experimental methods | text-as-data applications of machine learning
