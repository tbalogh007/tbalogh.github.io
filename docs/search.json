For a list of my publications and current research, please see the Research tab.\npolitical parties | political communication | electoral behavior | representation | survey & experimental methods | text-as-data applications of machine learning\n1. The Political Consequences of Parties‚Äô Group Appeals\nWhat effect do parties‚Äô appeals to social groups have on voters? Parties frequently utilize social group appeals in their political communication, both separate from and in addition to specific policy promises. Yet, the consequences of such appeals are largely unknown. In my dissertation work, I explore how underlying group attitudes shape the effect of parties‚Äô group appeals on political preferences. I find that party evaluations are influenced by group appeals, but only to the extent that the group is important (salient) to individuals. Appeals to groups that are well liked but not prioritized in political decisions do not have a significant effect on candidate choice or party evaluations. Moreover, I find individuals punish parties for ambiguous appeals to groups they prioritize, but not necessarily groups they merely feel positively towards. These findings reveal the importance of group salience, in addition to group affect, for understanding the effect of party‚Äôs group appeals on voters. It also suggests that parties are better off appealing to salient social groups than just well-liked ones, as such appeals are more likely to resonate with voters.\n2. Elite Influences on Policy Attitudes and Perceived Policy Impacts\nHow do individuals form beliefs about policy impacts, especially in relation to political parties and elites? This is a pertinent question, as public attitudes act as a significant barrier to successful policy implementation. In a joint working paper with fellow PhD student RyuGyung (Rio) Park, we explore the question of whether a political party‚Äôs perceived competence in a given issue area (such as the economy) spills over to attitudes in other issue areas. We do so in the context of environmental policies, asking whether individuals infer the impact of environmental policies from the issue ownership of the party supporting it. We argue that right-wing parties, who are typically considered to ‚Äúown‚Äù the issue of the economy, may have an advantage when promoting environmental policies, as they are perceived as having a more positive economic impact. In a pilot of an original survey experiment, we find some evidence of this.\nThis work falls squarely into my broader interest in how current partisan and political dynamics, such as rising green conservatism, influences policy attitudes. The next step is to run a larger-N experiment soon and to supplement our experimental findings with voting data to examine its real-world significance. We are also curious about the extent to which issue ownership spillover effects exist in other issue domains outside of environmental politics.\n3. Party Elites‚Äô Interactions and Citizen Perceptions\nHow do citizens infer the left-right distances between parties? Existing research has identified numerous sources of citizens‚Äô left-right party placements, such as the left-right orientation of parties‚Äô election manifestos, governing coalition arrangements, and media reports of party elites‚Äô interactions. Yet, what role does political sophistication play in the impact each of these different factors has for citizens‚Äô perceptions? Using cross-national survey data for 18 countries from 2001-2015, combined with a novel dataset on the level of cooperative interactions among party elites based on media reports, my co-authors and I find that the politically sophisticated weigh parties‚Äô election manifestos and media reports of elite interactions differently than the less sophisticated. Meanwhile, political sophistication has no effect on the weight of governing coalition arrangements. This research informs our understanding of how citizens perceive left-right distances and the (sometimes) moderating influence of political sophistication."

    "text": "Peer-Reviewed Publications\n‚ÄúDoes Political Sophistication Moderate How Citizens Use Information to Infer Left-Right Distances between Parties?‚Äù with Will Horne, Simon Weschle, James Adams, and Christopher Wlezien. 2025. Published in the Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties.\nAbstract: Research identifies numerous factors associated with citizens‚Äô perceptions of party ideologies, including the Left-Right orientations of parties‚Äô election manifestos, governing coalition arrangements, and media reports of party elites‚Äô interactions. We analyze whether citizens‚Äô reliance on these factors varies with their levels of education and political knowledge. In analyses of 51 election surveys from 18 countries between 2001 and 2015, we find that more politically sophisticated citizens attach (modestly) more weight to parties‚Äô election manifestos and media reports of political elites‚Äô interactions, but no evidence that sophistication moderates citizens‚Äô reactions to governing coalition arrangements. There thus appears to be far more homogeneity than heterogeneity in the structure of party placement perceptions.\n‚ÄúA comment on Herzog, Baron, and Gibbons‚Äù with Haley Daarstad and RyuGyung (Rio) Park. 2022. Published in I4R Discussion Paper Series, No.¬†97, Institute for Replication (I4R), s.l.\nAbstract: Herzog, Baron, and Gibbons (2022) explore the effects of exposure to official elite rhetoric and group cues on public support against the international nuclear weapons prohibition norm. The authors find that elite cues, in particular security and institutional cues, increase individuals‚Äô opposition to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW). However, elite cues do not seem to have an effect on changing individuals‚Äô broader attitudes towards nuclear weapons, as measured by individuals‚Äô existing opposition to nuclear arms. We replicate and expand the authors‚Äô methods and results to test the robustness of the effects found in the study. First, we reproduce the main finding using the authors‚Äô original data and method. We do not find any coding errors that undermine the authors‚Äô analysis or conclusions. Second, we test the robustness of the results by (1) using a different operationalization of party identity, and (2) calculating additional subgroup analysis for gender. We find no significant differences between our replicated and the original results, however females‚Äô support for the TPNW is more responsive to security cues, while males‚Äô support is more responsive to institutions cues.\nInvitations to Revise and Resubmit\n‚ÄúConjoint Analysis of Interpersonal Affective Polarization: Limits of Partisan Bias in Dating, Housing, and Shopping‚Äù with Spencer Kiesel and Sharif Amlani.\n\nRevise and Resubmit at Political Science Quarterly\nPresented at MPSA 2023, EPSA 2023, APSA 2023\n\nAbstract: Scholarship shows that partisanship can inform individuals‚Äô decisions in areas outside of politics, such as roommate choice, spousal selection, and economic behavior. However, few studies can systematically determine whether these decisions are based on partisanship or if they use partisanship to make inferences about other characteristics relevant to a given social choice. To determine to what extent partisanship informs decisions, we use a conjoint analysis to isolate the impact of partisanship on nonpolitical considerations across three types of social decisions: selecting a spouse to marry, a neighborhood to live in, and a business to frequent. We find that partisanship influences all three social decisions, even while controlling for other salient considerations. Further, we find that the degree to which partisanship matters is similar to and, in some cases, exceeds other relevant considerations. Overall, we show that when individuals make key decisions that affect the trajectory of their life, partisanship is a fundamental consideration.\nWorking Papers\n‚ÄúPolicies, But for Whom? Testing the Effect of Social Group Appeals on British Voters‚Äô Party Preferences‚Äù [Job Market Paper]\n\nPresented at MPSA 2024, UC Davis Political Science Research Workshop Spring 2024, APSA 2024, NYU CESS Experimental Political Science Conference 2025, MPSA 2025\nAvailable upon request\n\nAbstract: This study examines how political parties‚Äô rhetorical appeals to social groups affect voters‚Äô party preferences. Parties regularly appeal to social groups in their political communications, often pairing these appeals with policy promises. Yet, existing models of voting behavior focus almost exclusively on the role of policies. I use a pre-registered conjoint experiment fielded on a nationally representative sample of British adults that has voters consider parties‚Äô promises to social groups in four different issue areas, and I show that voters punish parties who explicitly appeal to women, while appeals to workers are more generally accepted. Moreover these effects are moderated by the importance of the group to the individual. I find that the punishing effect of appeals to women are not driven by men, but rather those who do not consider women important. These findings shed light on the role of group attitudes in explaining voting behavior and advance our understanding of the consequences of group appeals.\n‚ÄúThe Greens‚Äô Disadvantage: How Parties‚Äô Policy Reputations Shape Public Perceptions of Environmental Policy‚Äù with RyuGyung (Rio) Park\n\nPresented at MPSA 2024, EPG 2024, APSA 2024, Graduate Students in International Political Economy (GSIPE) 2025 Conference\nDraft available upon request\n\nAbstract: Traditionally, environmental policies, including measures to combat climate change, have been closely associated with left-wing parties, especially green parties, while right-wing parties have often been perceived as prioritizing economic interests over environmental concerns. However, we see an increasing number of right-wing parties starting to advocate more for environmental regulations, such as France‚Äôs National Rally, Spain‚Äôs Vox, or Latvia‚Äôs National Alliance. Do right-wing parties enjoy a certain advantage from their previous reputation for prioritizing the economy? We hypothesize that, controlling for individuals‚Äô ideology and stated issue priorities, environmental policies supported by parties that own economic issues will be perceived more favorably. On the other hand, environmental policies supported by parties that own environmental issues will be perceived less favorably. Meanwhile, when the policy is supported by an environment prioritizing party, the expected environmental impact will be more positive, but the expected economic impact will be more negative. To test our hypotheses, we use survey experiments conducted in the U.S. using vignettes on a hypothetical climate policy.\n‚ÄúWho Attacks Whom? The Correlates of Media Reports of Inter-party Conflict and Cooperation Between European Elites‚Äù with James Adams, Josephine Andrews, Timea Balogh, Braeden Davis, and Alexa Federice\n\nPresented at MPSA 2025\n\nAbstract: Political scientists are increasingly concerned about citizens‚Äô hostility and distrust towards political opponents, i.e., affective polarization, but also about citizens‚Äô declining confidence in parties, in government, and in democratic satisfaction. These phenomena are plausibly linked to media reports of elite-level inter-party conflict, which may intensify citizens‚Äô hostility towards opponents while more generally depressing their trust in political institutions. We analyze the correlates of European elites‚Äô inter-party conflict and cooperation in thirteen democracies between 2001 and 2019, based on the machine codings of nearly 15,000 news reports of elite interactions from legacy media. We estimate that the probability that a coded elite-level interaction is conflictual increases with party differences on European integration and on economic issues, with parties‚Äô differing populist orientations, and is also related to governing coalition arrangements. By contrast, we estimate no significant association between reports of elite-level conflict and party differences over cultural issues such as immigration and the national way of life."
